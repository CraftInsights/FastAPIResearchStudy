00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.500
Central tendency helps us identify the center or middle of our data.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.800
There are three ways we usually measure this:

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.600
the mean, the median, and the mode.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.300
Let's draw 5 random cards.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.600
Let's say we get a 2, a 3, a 7, a 10 and a Queen

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.800
In cards, a Jack counts as 11, Queen counts as 12 and the King is 13 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.400
The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by adding up all these 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.200
numbers and then dividing by the number of data points;

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
which is 5, since there are five total cards.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.000
So, if we add 2, 3, 7, 10 and 12, we get 34,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.400
dividing by 5 means our mean value is 6.8.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.800
Now, let's look at median.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.200
Median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800
After rearranging our cards in ascending order,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.100
we can see our median value here is 7

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.400
as it is the number in the middle of this sorted list of cards.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.000
But what if we had an extra card, how exactly do we find the middle?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.000
Just take the two middle numbers, add them up, and divide by 2.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.900
Lastly, lets talk about the mode.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.100
The mode is the number that appears most frequently in our data.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.000
If we drew an extra 7 for example, well that would make our mode seven.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.900
You can have more than one mode.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.800
In this specific example, we happen to have four threes and four Kings.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Here we can see we have two modes, so we can say it is bimodal.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.000
To summarize, mean, median and mode are all measures of central tendency.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.500
They each tell us something about the middle of our data.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.250
These measures can give us different information 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.200
and depending on our data we might choose to use one over the others.
