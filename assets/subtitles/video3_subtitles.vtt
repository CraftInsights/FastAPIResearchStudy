00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.200
Let's take another step forward towards understanding the concept of

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.600
variability and we'll continue using our trusty deck of playing cards 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.500
for our example.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.900
Variability, also known as dispersion, refers to how spread out

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or closely clustered a set of values are in a data set. 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.500
There are several ways to measure this 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.200
but we'll focus on three main ones:

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.400
range, variance and standard deviation.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.200
And standard deviation is a statistic that is reported very often.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.000
It is the most popular measure of variability that is reported

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.100
Let's draw 5 cards again.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.800
Suppose we got a 2, a 4, a 6, an 8 and a King 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.000
(which we know counts as 13).

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.500
The range is the simplest measure of variability.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.200
It's the difference between the highest and the lowest values

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.600
in our dataset.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.400
So in our case, if we subtract 2 from 13, we get a range of 11.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now let's look at a dataset of numbers, 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.200
and plot the points on a numberline.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's do the same with another set of numbers.

00:01:23.486 --> 00:01:26.486
For both of these datasets, the average is 5.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.500
But we can see that the way the numbers are dispersed

00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:34.500
are different in each set, they vary between themselves.

00:01:39.643 --> 00:01:42.843
We can draw smoother lines using statistical software

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:45.286
that visually displays this difference.

00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:48.286
We can see that they are shaped differently.

00:01:49.114 --> 00:01:52.114
So let's explore this difference, and let's move to a slightly

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:53.514
more complex measure. 

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:02.829
Variance tells us how much our data diverges from the mean.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.400
To find it, we calculate the average of the squared differences

00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:07.200
from the mean.

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.929
Don't worry about the calculations too much,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.229
we want to focus on the underlying concepts.

00:02:19.257 --> 00:02:21.857
But if you are curious about the math, the next segment

00:02:21.858 --> 00:02:24.457
will briefly go over the calculations once more.

00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:26.471
The important thing to note is that they build upon

00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:29.071
the concepts you learned at the beginning of the video.

00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:32.857
Here are the calculations once more.

00:02:32.858 --> 00:02:34.957
We first find the average of the card numbers;

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.357
this gives us a mean of 6.6. 

00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:41.557
After that, we take the difference between each cards value

00:02:41.558 --> 00:02:44.957
and the mean, which we calculated to be 6.6,

00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.057
then we square these differences.

00:02:51.714 --> 00:02:54.414
Once we have our squared differences, we add them up

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:57.114
and finally divide by the number of data points.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.000
In other words, the total amount of cards which is 5.

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:01.400
This gives us the variance.

00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:22.271
Finally we come to the standard deviation.

00:03:22.272 --> 00:03:25.171
to get the standard deviation, all we have to do

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:28.071
is simply take the square root of the variance.

00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:40.514
So, with range, variance, and standard deviation,

00:03:40.515 --> 00:03:42.114
we get a clearer picture of our data.

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:44.056
Not just where the middle is, but also

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.157
how much our data tends to deviate from that middle.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.514
Together with the measures of central tendency,

00:03:49.515 --> 00:03:52.586
These are powerful tools for understanding our data.
