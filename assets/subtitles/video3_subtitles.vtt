00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.500
Let's take another step forward towards understanding the concept of

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.700
variability and we'll continue using our trusty deck of playing cards 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.500
for our example.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.900
Variability, also known as dispersion, refers to how spread out

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or closely clustered a set of values are in a data set. 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.500
There are several ways to measure this 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.200
but we'll focus on three main ones:

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.400
range, variance and standard deviation.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.200
And standard deviation is a statistic that is reported very often.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.000
It is the most popular measure of variability that is reported

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.100
Let's draw 5 cards again.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.800
Suppose we got a 2, a 4, a 6, an 8 and a King 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.000
(which we know counts as 13).

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.500
The range is the simplest measure of variability.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.200
It's the difference between the highest and the lowest values

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.600
in our dataset.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.400
So in our case, if we subtract 2 from 13, we get a range of 11.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now let's look at a dataset of numbers, 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.200
and plot the points on a numberline.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.000
Let's do the same with another set of numbers.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.800
For both of these datasets, the average is 5.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.100
But we can see that the way the numbers are dispersed

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.200
are different in each set, they vary between themselves.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.600
We can draw smoother lines using statistical software

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.000
that visually displays this difference.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.200
We can see that they are shaped differently.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So let's explore this difference, and let's move to a slightly

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.500
more complex measure. 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.600
Variance tells us how much our data diverges from the mean.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.400
To find it, we calculate the average of the squared differences

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.300
from the mean.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.800
Don't worry about the calculations too much,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.200
we want to focus on the underlying concepts.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.600
But if you are curious about the math, the next segment

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.300
will briefly go over the calculations once more.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.400
The important thing to note is that they build upon

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.000
the concepts you learned at the beginning of the video.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.400
Here are the calculations once more.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.700
We first find the average of the card numbers;

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.200
this gives us a mean of 6.6. 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.300
After that, we take the difference between each cards value

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.800
and the mean, which we calculated to be 6.6,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.000
then we square these differences.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.200
Once we have our squared differences, we add them up

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.000
and finally divide by the number of data points.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.000
In other words, the total amount of cards which is 5.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.500
This gives us the variance.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.000
Finally we come to the standard deviation.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.000
to get the standard deviation, all we have to do

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.000
is simply take the square root of the variance.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.900
So, with range, variance, and standard deviation,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.600
we get a clearer picture of our data.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.600
Not just where the middle is, but also

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.800
how much our data tends to deviate from that middle.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.000
Together with the measures of central tendency,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.000
these are powerful tools for understanding our data.
