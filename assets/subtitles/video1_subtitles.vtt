00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Hello and welcome.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.000
Today we're going to talk about the importance of data.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.000
How data can be analyzed.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.400
How data can be visualized as illustrated here on this graph.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.300
And we will also highlight two important fundamental concepts in statistics:

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.000
Central tendency & Variability

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The goal is for you to walk away with a better understanding of statistics

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so find a comfortable place relax and enjoy.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.000
Let's first begin with a simple example

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.000
suppose you were tasked with recording the amount of customers

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.500
that walk into a restaurant every hour

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.500
At 2 p.m, there are 8 customers,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.500
at 3, there are 4,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.000
at 4 there are eleven and so on.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.300
The restaurant closes at 11 p.m, after which you

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.800
tally up the total number of customers that came by to eat.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.500
You find that on Saturday for example,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.500
there were a total of 136 customers.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.600
If you were to plot the data in a chart, it would look something like this.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.500
You might have seen something like this before.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.300
Google displays a similar graph online,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.900
when you go to search up whether a place is busy or not.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.000
Data is a big part of our daily lives.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.200
In the next two videos, you will see animations that explain

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.900
common methods that people use in statistics

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to make sense of data and derive insights from it.
