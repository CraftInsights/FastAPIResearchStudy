00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.900
Let's put everything that we have learned so far together.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.800
Imagine you were teaching an English class of 20 students.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.800
They wrote a final exam and these are their grades:

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.800
The statistics below the graph should be familiar to you at this point.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.800
It is common practice however,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.000
to report mainly the mean and the standard deviation.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.000
If we want, we could move the standard deviation

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.500
onto the graph itself for a more visual representation.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.500
Let's begin first by marking the mean

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.500
onto the graph with a red line.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.200
Now let's mark one standard deviation

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.000
above the mean with an orange line.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.300
Five grades fall within this area as highlighted above.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.000
When we plot one standard deviation below the mean,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.600
we see 30% of the grades fall within this area.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.200
The 6th grades are highlighted above.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.000
And we can see when we plot two standard deviations

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.100
away from the mean,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.000
all of the grades fall within this area.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100
But remember, data can be shaped and dispersed differently

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.000
so this won't be true of all reported data.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.100
It just so happens to be true here.
